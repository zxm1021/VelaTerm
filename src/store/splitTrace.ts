//! Diagnostic trail for split panes: who created one, and when.
//!
//! Split panes are only ever produced by `splitNew` (keyboard shortcut, menu bar), by
//! placing an existing session into a split (sidebar menu, drop onto a pane, tiling), or carried in wholesale
//! by a peer's mirror layout. Both are silent: a new pane shows a bare prompt, and the
//! pane tree is persisted, so a split created without notice looks like it appeared on its own days later.
//! This records each event so the source can be identified after the fact.
//!
//! Entries are retained in memory and persisted by the backend to the application runtime log. Native remote
//! windows use their local host so the file retains the originating window label. Plain browsers
//! use their connected server. Read the recent entries via `window.__vlxSplitLog` (newest last).
