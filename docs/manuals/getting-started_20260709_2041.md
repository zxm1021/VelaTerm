> This guide takes you from installation to your first terminal and your first AI agent session. It is enough to start working; each feature is described in detail in the other manuals (see the [Manuals Overview](manuals-overview_20260709_2041.md)).

## 1. What VelaTerm is

VelaTerm is a terminal manager built for working with AI coding agents. It organizes terminal and agent sessions in a **project → group → session** tree and runs coding agents such as Claude Code and Codex as dedicated sessions: you can see at any time whether an agent is working, needs your input or has finished, and reopening a session continues its conversation. Agents can run in their own terminal interface or in a conversation view with messages, tool cards and permission buttons. Browser remote access and SSH remote development let you continue your sessions from other devices.

## 2. Installation

Download the package for your platform:

| Platform | Package | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| macOS | `.dmg` (separate Apple Silicon and Intel builds) | Open it and drag VelaTerm into Applications. The app is notarized by Apple |
| Windows | `-setup.exe` installer, in min and full variants | full (about 360 MB) includes a complete Git Bash; min (about 25 MB) downloads missing commands when needed. Both install to the same location, so choose one |
| Linux | `.AppImage` (x86_64 and aarch64) | Make it executable and run it; no installation is needed |

VelaTerm checks for updates automatically; "Check for Updates…" in the app menu checks immediately.

## 3. First launch: add a project

On first launch the sidebar is empty and offers three ways to add a project:

- "Create Project" creates a new folder and adds it.
- "Open Project" (⌘O, Ctrl+Alt+O on Windows and Linux) adds an existing folder.
- "Clone from Git" clones a repository and adds it.

The same actions are available as buttons in the sidebar header. Inside a project you can create **groups**, nested as deeply as you like (for example frontend, backend, testing), and **sessions** inside them:

## 4. Open your first terminal

Any of these opens a scratch terminal:

1. Press ⌘T (Ctrl+Alt+T on Windows and Linux).
2. Hover a project, group or session in the sidebar, click the ＋ button, and choose "New Terminal". The terminal starts in that node's directory. Project and group context menus have the same item.
3. When the center pane is empty, click "Create Terminal".

Scratch terminals exist only as tabs: they never become tree nodes and are discarded when closed, which makes them suitable for quick commands.

## 5. Open your first AI agent session

Right-click a project or group and choose "New Claude Session". The first level of the menu offers Claude, Codex and OpenCode; "More Agent Session" lists all fourteen supported agents. You can also press ⌘N (Ctrl+Alt+N on Windows, Linux and in regular browsers) to open a searchable list of agents.

VelaTerm starts the agent in the project directory. Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Pi and OMP sessions open in the **conversation view**: type your message in the box at the bottom and press Enter. The other agents open in the **terminal view**, which shows the agent's own terminal interface. Settings ▸ Agents ▸ "Default view" picks which view a new session opens in; see [Conversation View](conversation-view_20260925_1012.md).

From then on you get three things:

- **Status dots**: the dot next to the session in the sidebar shows the agent's state. Green means working, yellow means it needs you (a question or a permission request), and magenta means it has replied and you have seen it.
- **System notifications**: when the agent stops and waits for you, you receive a notification. If you are already looking at the session, no notification appears.
- **Automatic resume**: close the tab, or quit the app, and the next time you open the session the conversation continues where it stopped. For a new conversation, create a new session.

If the agent's CLI is not installed yet, the session shows an install card with the recommended install command for your system and an "Install now" button.

## 6. A quick tour

![Main window](../assets/manuals/main-ui.png)

- **Left sidebar**: the project tree with a search box and a status filter. Header buttons: Create Project, Import Project, Clone from Git, Search All Sessions, and Archived Sessions.
- **Center pane**: the tab bar and the open sessions. By default, clicking an agent session in the tree reuses the current tab, and the previous tab keeps running in the background. Closing a tab ends its processes. Tabs can be split into panes (⌘D right, ⌘⇧D down).
- **Right panel**: follows the current session, with four tabs: Files, Info (session details, account usage, context and resource use), Git (branch, changes and commits), and Knowledge Base.
- **Status bar**: session count, current session type, Git branch, permission mode, notification switch, and the Working / Pending / Viewed counters. Click a counter to show only those sessions in the sidebar.
- **Title bar, right side**: theme switch, Remote Access, Connect to Remote Server, Share, Settings, Account, Feedback, and the buttons that show or hide the side panels.
